## Running a three-tier-application using Docker

To run Three Tier Application using Docker, we need to first clone a Full Stack Project. We can use any of our Full Stack Project but if we donâ€™t have one then we can use someone else project also. Here, I have used a very easy simple project on GitLab. The link to this project is https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/developing-with-docker. This project is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express and MongoDB.

1. First you need to clone the Project Repository from the link using command
git clone https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/developing-with-docker

2. Then create a mongo network

3. Pull mongo image

4. pull mongo-express image

5. Run both the images using docker

6. Open mongo-express in any browser, where you can create databases

7. Create a Dockerfile and add below commands to the file

8. Build a Docker image of the project

9. Run the created image of your project

10. Open your project in any browser by searching _localhost:3000_ (There can be different ports)
Below is my simple project that I have deployed using Docker.

11. You can also see the change in MongoDB database when I make changes in the project.

So, this is how you can deploy yourr three-tier-application using Docker!!

## Uploading Image to DockerHub
12. Finally, we will upload our project image to DockerHub for better containerization.
For that, you need to log-in or create a new account on DockerHub if you don't have one.

To run a Three Tier Application, we need to run three Docker Containers simultaneously. So, it is necessary to run all these containers inside a network to avoid their interaction with other containers.

So, this is a step-by-step method to deploy your project using Docker.
Thank you for reading my Blog!!
